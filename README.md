# KASPA Mining Pool using rusty-kaspa WASM

Once the RPC connection is established, the pool initializes the treasury, which listens for UTXO events. When these events occur, the treasury processes them to track available funds. Next, templates are fetched and stored to generate job IDs for miners. These jobs are then distributed to miners for processing. Miners connect to the pool via the stratum protocol, subscribing and submitting their work (shares).

The shares are validated, and their difficulty is checked. Valid shares are counted, and blocks found are recorded. The pool uses this data to calculate the total hash rate and the contributions of each miner. Periodically, the pool distributes rewards based on each miner's contribution, allocating payments from the treasury and having them ready for the next payment cycle.

## How the block templates are fetched

We are fetching Block templates from GRPC endpoint. This is done through a Go-script. And this templates are passed on to a Redis channel.

## Download Kaspa WASM SDK

**Note:** This setup is intended for **local development only**.

### Steps:

1. Download the latest Kaspa WASM SDK from the official Rusty-Kaspa GitHub releases:
   [rusty-kaspa/releases](https://github.com/kaspanet/rusty-kaspa/releases)

2. Locate and download the file named:
   kaspa-wasm32-sdk-<LATEST_VERSION>.zip

Example: `kaspa-wasm32-sdk-v1.0.0.zip`

3. Extract the archive and locate the `nodejs` directory inside it.

4. Rename the extracted `nodejs` folder to `wasm` and place it inside your project repository.

The folder should contain:

- `kaspa`
- `kaspa-dev`

5. Ensure that the import paths in your code correctly reference the local `wasm` folder.

## Docker Compose

The recommended installation is via docker compose. There are many instances that are required to have a full functionality of the pool solution.

![internal container design](images/katpool-internal-container-design.jpg)

### Container Instances

- **kaspad**  
  Kaspa full node.

- **katpool-app**  
  Main application. This is the core component of the repository.

- **katpool-db**  
  PostgreSQL database instance.

- **katpool-db-migrate**  
  Handles database schema changes such as altering and adding new tables.

- **katpool-backup**  
  Performs regular database dumps and uploads them to Google Drive.

- **[katpool-monitor](https://github.com/Nacho-the-Kat/katpool-monitor)**  
  Initializes with configuration from `katpool-app`, shares miner balances and totals as Prometheus metrics, and serves Express REST APIs.

- **prometheus**  
  Pulls metrics from `katpool-monitor` and visualizes pool statistics.

- **[go-app](https://github.com/Nacho-the-Kat/katpool-blocktemplate-fetcher)**  
  Fetches new block templates from the Kaspa network via gRPC and publishes them to a Redis channel. `katpool-app` listens to this channel.

- **redis**  
  Acts as a messaging channel between `go-app` and `katpool-app` for block templates.

- **[katpool-payment](https://github.com/Nacho-the-Kat/katpool-payment)**  
  Handles payment processing. Reads balances from the database and distributes payouts.

- **nginx**  
  Serves as the reverse proxy for routing incoming HTTP requests to appropriate services.

### Create env variables

All application instances currently use the same environment variables defined in the `.env` file. A sample template is provided in `.env.sample` for reference.

In the future, it is recommended to isolate certain environment variables based on the application’s role. Specifically, the private key should be assigned only to the `payment` app. The `katpool-app` instance does not require access to this key and should not be granted it for security and clarity of responsibility.

This separation will improve security, reduce unnecessary exposure, and better align with the principle of least privilege.

### requires folders and files

- prometheus.yml: prometheus scrape configuration
- init.sql: to setup the database the first time it's started
- migrate.sql: to make changes to current database. Add new table, update existing table. NOTE: Overwrite the content of this file for performing latest changes.
- nginx.conf
- config
- **wasm** folder must the also available. Check download link above [For running outside Docker container]

### Configuration

- In `prometheus.yml` **update the targets**.

- Check `config/config.json` and do the required configurations to your pool.

  - **Assumption**: The **initial pool[0th pool]** is a **variable difficulty (var diff) pool** with a default port set to **8888**. Additionally, it includes support for **user-defined difficulty** settings.

    - To enable user-defined difficulty, user needs to set difficulty as `d=2048` in password field.

  - Please refer to [Crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru/) to set these two cron expressions.

  * **payoutCronSchedule**: cron schedule expression for payout. If not set or invalid, it will be defaulted to Twice a day (\* _/12 _ \* \*).

  * **backupCronSchedule**: cron schedule expression for backup. If not set or invalid, it will be defaulted to Twice a day (\* _/12 _ \* \*).

  * **payoutAlertCronSchedule**: cron schedule expression for Telegram alerting. If not set or invalid, it will be defaulted to four times a day (0 1,7,13,19 \* \* \*).

  * **thresholdAmount**: Miner rewards will be paid above this minimum amount in sompi

  * **block_wait_time_milliseconds**: time to wait since last new block message from kaspad before manually requesting a new block.

    - **Note**: It is to be set in **seconds**.

  * **extraNonceSize** The value should be between 0 to 3.

### Container Images

We provide a `docker-compose.yml` setup for easier deployment. However, since this is an open-source project and no pre-built container images are published, you are expected to build the images locally and update the image URLs accordingly.

To build the `katpool-app` image locally, run the following command from the root of the repository (where the `Dockerfile` is located):

```
docker build -t ghcr.io/<your-ghcr-username>/katpool-app:0.65 .
```

Once built, make sure to push the image to your GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) or your preferred container registry.

Then, update the `docker-compose.yml` and any relevant deployment files to use your own image:

```yaml
image: ghcr.io/<your-ghcr-username>/katpool-app:0.65
```

## Mining Port Configuration

The mining pool supports multiple static difficulty ports, defined in the `config/config.json` file.

### Stratum Difficulty Ports

Each port is mapped to a specific difficulty level. This enables miners to choose a port appropriate for their hardware.

- **Port 8888** supports **variable difficulty**, starting at 2048 and automatically adjusting based on miner performance.
- Miners can also set a **custom difficulty** on port 8888 using the `password` field during connection. This overrides the assigned difficulty.

**Example usage:**
password: x d=2048

### Example Port Configuration

```json
"ports": {
  "8888": { "difficulty": 2048 },
  "1111": { "difficulty": 256 },
  "2222": { "difficulty": 1024 }
}
```

- **Note**: Ports with static difficulty (e.g., 1111, 2222) cannot be overridden via the password field.

### Start and check the pool

To start the pool, you need to run `docker compose up -d` or the required command depending of your docker setup
You can use `docker logs -f katpool-app` to see the output of your pool instance. We recommned to use DEBUG=1 at the beginning.
After ten minites you should be able to connect to the metrics, received info fo the state of the treasury and configurations via port 8080 at the following paths

- `http://<pool-server>:8080` it would take you to the promtheus interface. Check the `index.ts` file in `src/prometheus` folder for the metrics.
- `http://<pool-server>:8080/config` to see the initial config of the pool
- `http://<pool-server>:8080/balance` to see the balance for all miners
- `http://<pool-server>:8080/total` to see the total been rewarded to the miners ever

### Backup

Optionally, you can add a backup process to the DB. Check the ./backup folder.
You can build the suggested image via `docker build -t katpool-backup:0.4 .` and uncomment its part in the docker-compose.yml file.
We recommend to transfer the database dump files to other location as additional protection.

# App Components Description

### The Mining Cycle: Step-by-Step

1. **Starting the Server**:

   - The Stratum server starts and begins listening for connections from miners.
   - The server connects to the Kaspa network via the RPC client. It fetches block templates from Redis channel.

2. **Fetching Block Templates**:

   - We have used [go-app](https://github.com/Nacho-the-Kat/katpool-blocktemplate-fetcher): to fetch new block template from the Kaspa network using _gRPC_ connection and sends them over Redis channel.
   - Katpool-app fetches block templates from Redis channel.
   - It creates a PoW object from the template to help miners validate their work.
   - The block template and PoW object are stored in the `templates` map.

3. **Distributing Jobs to Miners**:

   - A job is created from the block template, encoding the necessary data.
   - The job is sent to all connected miners, instructing them on what work to perform.

4. **Miners Start Working**:

   - Each miner starts working on the job by trying to find a valid nonce.
   - A valid nonce, when combined with the block template and hashed, must meet the difficulty target.

5. **Submitting Shares**:
   - When a miner finds a nonce, they submit a share back to the server.
   - The server checks if the share is valid:
     - It retrieves the PoW object from the `templates` map.
     - It validates the nonce against the difficulty target.
6. **Accepting or Rejecting Shares**:

   - **Valid Share**: If the nonce is valid and meets the target, the server:
     - Adds the share to the `works` map for tracking.
     - If the share completes a valid block, it submits the block to the Kaspa network.
     - Notifies the miner of the successful submission.
   - **Invalid Share**: If the nonce is invalid or duplicated:
     - The share is rejected.
     - The miner is notified of the rejection.

7. **Handling New Templates**:
   - As new block templates are created (typically when a new block is added to the blockchain), the server fetches the new templates.
   - The server sends the new job to all miners, starting the cycle again.

### Example Cycle

1. **Server Starts**: The server starts and listens for miners.
2. **Fetch Template**:  
   Block templates are fetched from the Kaspa network by the `go-app` service using a gRPC connection.  
   These templates are then published to a Redis channel, which is subscribed to by the `katpool-app` service.
3. **Create Job**: The server creates a job from the template.
4. **Distribute Job**: The job is sent to miners.
5. **Miners Work**: Miners start finding a valid nonce.
6. **Submit Share**: A miner submits a share.
7. **Validate Share**:
   - **If Valid**:
     - The share is added to `works`.
     - If it's a valid block, it's submitted to Kaspa.
     - Miner is notified of success.
   - **If Invalid**:
     - The share is rejected.
     - Miner is notified of rejection.
8. **New Template**: A new block is added to the blockchain.
9. **Fetch New Template**: The server fetches a new block template, and the cycle repeats.

### Summary

The Stratum app manages the entire lifecycle of mining jobs, from distributing tasks to miners, validating their work, and submitting completed blocks to the Kaspa network. This ensures a smooth and efficient mining operation, with miners continuously working on up-to-date templates and the pool efficiently handling their contributions.
